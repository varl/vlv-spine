<h2>Simplifying Agile Planning</h2>
<p>During the summer months The Project realises that people take vacations, which
by law in Norway equates to most people taking a minimum of 3-weeks leave to
fornicate, enjoy the rain and indulge in intercourse while the rain smatters on
the windows.</p>
<p>While this is all fun &amp; games until someone strains some part of the
relevant anatomy (a book for nurses, as opposed to the irrelevant anatomy, of
which I cannot find a book), I meanwhile got shifted to a meta-team and got to
see how efficient we in my normal team have become in our planning day.</p>
<p>We emphasize the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Efficiency 2. Teamwork 3. Minimising &ldquo;dead
time&rdquo;</li>
<li>Using experience numbers {endpre} Sounds like something everyone says
they do, right? That's the danger of not running a constant introspection
question, quite simply: <em>&ldquo;What the Hell are we doing?&ldquo;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This is our <em>Way-of-Work</em>:</p>
<p>We have a couple of jobs for today, starting with: {pre} 1. Filling up our
team-queue from candidates in the MASTERPLAN 2. Breaking down the MASTERPLAN
tasks into sub-tasks 3. Estimating the tasks/sub-tasks 4. Determining the
contract for the iteration {endpre} The schedule might look like: {pre}
09:00-12:00   Copy tasks into queue and break down into sub-tasks 12:00-14:00
Estimate tasks and determine contract {endpre} {b}Time block:
{em}09-12{endem}{endb} In The Project there exists queues. One that the project
maintains, called the Masterplan and one per team. I will just use one TEAM in
my examples.  {pre} MASTERPLAN          TEAM &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; {endpre}
All tasks are prioritised and tagged with an iteration. So come planning day
the MASTERPLAN queue is filled with tasks that are candidates for us to work
on.  {pre} MASTERPLAN          TEAM &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 1000 1001 1002
1003 1004 {endpre} Our first job is to copy the tasks into our queue and link
them to the MASTERPLAN tasks.</p>
<p>We do this as a team. We just claim an issue from MASTERPLAN that we will copy
into our queue and announce it to the team, &ldquo;Hey, starting at the top with
MASTERPLAN-1000&rdquo;, might be yelled or e-mailed to the team.  {pre} MASTERPLAN
TEAM &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 1000      &mdash;>     1,2,3 1001      &mdash;>         4
1002      &mdash;>       5,6 1003      &mdash;>         7 1004      &mdash;>         8
{endpre} While copying it, an attempt to break it into sub-tasks is made. This
is not final, and is subject to change during the team meeting later on.</p>
<p>Our team has a nice track record of experience numbers when fixing bugs so we
have &ldquo;standard tasks and estimates&rdquo; that we apply to the less complex tasks
like finding/killing bugs. When we encounter one we just mark it as &ldquo;standard
estimates used&rdquo; and when we create sub-tasks on the copy, we fill in the
standard estimate values. When we go over the issues at the meeting we agree or
disagree that the standard values will or will not work and change as argued.</p>
<p>Time block: <em>12-14</em> After lunch we gather the team in a room
and start to estimate the broken down tasks. We realised that we are most
efficient when we estimate in half-days and full-days. We realise that if a
task takes more than 5 days it is in need of being broken down further.</p>
<p>What (normally) has five digits?</p>
<p>We use a simplified version of planning poker with our hands. One finger is one
day and a crooked finger is half a day. The way we go about it is just hold up
a closed fist when you are ready to play and then the scrum master makes the
count: &ldquo;1&hellip; 2&hellip; 3!&ldquo;, and the digits fly.</p>
<p>The highest and lowest explain why they chose so high/low and then we play
again.</p>
<p>We fill out the sub-tasks that doesn't already have estimates set, go over the
sub-tasks that have standard estimates set and make the tally.</p>
<p>If everything fits into the iteration we are done and the contract is final,
and if everything doesn't fit (99.99% percent of the time) we ruthlessly cut
everything with the lowest priority (set on a project management basis) and
re-tag those tasks for the next iteration.</p>
<p>This might seem like common sense, but every other team in The Project books a
room for the entire day with one laptop and a projector and the scrum master
sits there, copying and creating sub-tasks and estimating everything
one-by-one, for the entire day while the team sits surfing on their
cell-phones/daydreaming/being-bored-out-of-their-goddamn-minds. Then again,
something like this requires experienced team members, excellent communciation
and an established self-organised team to be viable.</p>
<p>And so ends how we tamed our 8 hour planning days into something that is
enjoyable for the entire team.</p>
