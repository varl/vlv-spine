                <p><h1>Dropping off the grid</h1>
<p>April 2013</p>
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Is it possible for an ordinary citizen in Scandinavia to drop off the grid?</p>
<p>This is a question I have been asking myself for a long time, and it is constantly re-fueled by reading about people
that <em>do</em> manage to live a semi-/completely self-sustaining Life.</p>
<p>Everything from modern-day hippies to software developers have proved that they are fully capable of living with no-to-few
&ldquo;modern niceties&rdquo;. Why aren't more people interested in such a life? It seems remarkably Happy. Hell, the software
developer mentioned even had a working computer that was powered by solar energy, so he could get some work done from
home as well.</p>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>The first an most obvious of the factors that enable an off-the-grid lifestyle is the location. It's easier to live
without the support of society if you don't constantly have to worry about freezing to death in your sleep, so obviously
places that have a consistent and milder climate enable easier living.</p>
<p><img src="attachments/2013-04/world_temp_map.png" alt="World temperature map" /></p>
<p>The image above (from climate-charts.com) shows that areas that are orange/red would probably be the easiest to survive
for extended periods of time with less preparation and more improvisation than areas that are yellow-to-green.</p>
<p>So, off the get-go I find myself at a disadvantage and the care-free lifestyle enjoyed by self-sustainers in California,
Texas and Greece seems farfetched. Living closer to the arctic circle means that going off-grid would pretty much be
restricted to the summer since in central Oslo we have hit sub-zero temperatures as low as -25 degrees celsius,
not to mention that the sun rises late and sets early during the same months in addition to sources of water getting
frozen solid, further restricting any plans to harvest power from solar/water energy nearby.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. Living off the grid during the summer months sounds extremely pleasant in my ears, so hiding in
the capital of Norway during winter sounds like an OK trade-off.</p>
<p>I think my criterias for a location would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secluded, in a forest</li>
<li>Mountain/lake nearby</li>
</ul>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>It has been said that we are all born with a housing deficit, and I would like something a bit more stable than a tent
to protect me from the elements and wild-life. I do not want to spend a lot of money on building a cottage, so I am
looking at shipping containers to use as a frame for my house.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container_architecture">to do so</a> and the upsides are
astonishing. I have done some rough calculations, and for around 500'000 SEK, I would be able to buy a piece of land
and have a &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; placed there ready for action.</p>
<p>Further improvement, like isolation and floorboards, installing a furnace, etcetera can be done ad-hoc and as needed.</p>
<p>Hell, I can even get two containers &ndash; one to live in and one to house my MC, complete with enough area to store and
work on it, without blowing a hole in my wallet that will never get filled.</p>
<h2>Finances</h2>
<p>I do not like being in debt, I want to live on what I have, not what I'm worth.</p>
