                <p><h1>Gym failure 2013 ed</h1>
<p>It is a harsh realisation that I have once again managed to injure myself
to the point of it ruining a year of gains.</p>
<p>I switched my gym schedule to a new routine in January, and looking back on
my workout log (wlog?) it has not been a kind year for my body. Sigh.</p>
<p>Looking back a couple of years, when I tried Doggcrapp last, I eventually
wound up with the same injuries, but on the left side instead of the right.
Obviously, I'm not cut out for that schedule, even though it has the fewest
amount of sessions per week I've done in years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wish I could go back to my student days, when me and a mate
had a rigorous schedule of 5 sessions per week, but only one 'lift' a day.</p>
<p>I have never come close to match the personal bests I set during that time
since. Now I spend time and money on e.g. MRI scans and preemptive care.</p>
<p>Alas; new schedule, then.</p>
<h2>5x5</h2>
<p>I have been experimenting with a 5x5 setup with a 2-split 3 days a week. The
2-split is based on doggcrap, but without the restpausing of sets, giving my
joints more time to recuperate between sets and hopefully avoid overloading my
forearms (&hellip; again).</p>
<p>In doggcrapp fashion I am still opting for a setup of 3 exercises per muscle
group, which means week 1 I will have two (1) sessions and one (2) session,
and week 2, two (2) sessions and one (1). A full rotation of exercises takes
two weeks, as such.</p>
<p>The main principles I will adhere to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Down is easy; make it hard</strong></li>
<li><strong>Use lower weight and better form</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A full cycle of exercises would look like:</p>
<p>1-1</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward leaning cable press</li>
<li>Military barbell press</li>
<li>Close-grip barbell benchpress</li>
<li>Weighted chins</li>
<li>Pronated bent-over barbell rows</li>
</ul>
<p>2-1</p>
<ul>
<li>Standing barbell curls</li>
<li>Sitting calf-press machine (plate loaded)</li>
<li>Sitting single leg curls machine (stack loaded)</li>
<li>Back squats</li>
</ul>
<p>1-2</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat dumbbell bench press</li>
<li>Sitting dumbbell shoulder press (no backrest)</li>
<li>Close-grip weighted dips</li>
<li>Cable pull-downs</li>
<li>Supinated bent-over barbell rows</li>
</ul>
<p>2-2</p>
<ul>
<li>Close-grip pull-ups</li>
<li>Rotary calf-press machine (stack loaded)</li>
<li>Good mornings</li>
<li>Front squats</li>
</ul>
<p>1-3</p>
<ul>
<li>Chestpress machine (plate loaded)</li>
<li>Shoulder press machine (plate loaded)</li>
<li>Lying barbell triceps extensions</li>
<li>Pull-down machine (plate loaded)</li>
<li>Deadlifts</li>
</ul>
<p>2-3</p>
<ul>
<li>90° preacher curls</li>
<li>Calf-press in leg press machine (plate loaded)</li>
<li>Straight leg deadlifts</li>
<li>45° leg press machine (plate loaded)</li>
</ul>
<p>All-in-all, it's pretty much the same exercises as I've done so far in 2013, but
in addition to moving from a rest-pause based approach to a 5x5 based, I have
removed the forearm specific ones (pronated and supinated wristcurls, hammer
curls) to reduce load on my elbows, and hopefully avoid further cases of
'mouse arm'.</p>
<p>We'll see how this works out for the remainder of 2013.</p>
<p>Good luck, me.</p>
<h2>Update 2013-10-28</h2>
<p>Still on 5x5, but vastly simplified. I've come to the conclusion that I have
been overtraining and that's why my gains have been severely set back.</p>
<p>I switched to a simpler A/B workout schedule last week and already I have
increased the weight for squats past what I've been using for the last
year.</p>
<h2>A:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Squats</li>
<li>Flat BB benchpress</li>
<li>Bent-over supinated BB rows</li>
</ul>
<h2>B:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Squats</li>
<li>Standing barbell military press</li>
<li>Deadlift</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it.</p>
