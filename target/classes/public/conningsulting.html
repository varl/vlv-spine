<p>January 2014</p>
<p>Even though the word [consult] comes from Latin and French, giving estimates feels closer to conning than advising. In response, we make it abstract; we talk about &ldquo;rough estimatesÂ»&rdquo; story points, units of work, anything that gives us some wiggle-room in what is actually promised. You cannot spell consulting without con.</p>
<p>The higher the pressure; the higher the urge to cut up the problem into pieces; the closer to using concrete [sic] terms like &ldquo;minutes&rdquo; and &ldquo;hours&rdquo; we get, a process that reminds me of how cons work. Maintain wiggle-room. Never give absolute answers. In the words of Bruce Lee, &ldquo;Be like water, my friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Early this year I got my partner a lemon tree, and just for fun I tried to estimate how long it would take to reach various stages.</p>
<p>It turns out that plants are as unpredictable as growing software. Fruits fall off when they aren't supposed. They require the nourishment and respite. There are productive stages. There are unproductive stages. Changes that should have no affect nearly killed it.</p>
<p>And, then, the bugs&hellip;</p>
<p>I realise that the system in which we operate is based around estimates, but I also realise that the only way to beat a system is to not be a part of it.</p>
<p>Can we change the rules in the long run? Pretty please, with sugar on top?</p>
<p>/v.</p>
