                <p><p>I once had a dream where-in a long-time friend had been keeping a secret,
that he had fathered a child with a girl too young,
kept secret in a small community outside town, a house accounted for by his kin,
visiting always when he could, hard at first, biking through what winter proved,
easier then, when behind the wheel, and so everything fell into horrid place</p>
<p>How was I so blind? The signs were there. Behaviours explained. Everything
neatly arranged, so simple.</p>
<p>But it was a dream, and once awoken, no cycle was broken</p>
