<p>I used to be fast.</p>
<p>Now, not so much. Maybe it's this keyboard. Maybe it's that I no longer touch-
type. Which is kind of weird, I think I used to do it; At least at work I don't
feel impeded by my typing speed, but at home I do. Why is this?</p>
<p>Am I really a faster typist at work than at home? Is it the constant clicking
and clacking of my mechanical keyboard that does it or am I simply overthinking
it? Is it perhaps that I don't get in the flow as fast; that I don't type as
much nor in as long stretches of time as I do at work?</p>
<p>Am I expelled into a land where all I do is quickly answer IM's over e-mail,</p>
<p>on Facebook,</p>
<p>on Hangouts,</p>
<p>on IRC,</p>
<p>on Text,</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>My mind scattered and divided between dozens of tiny shards of data, never
allowed to simply relax, focus and spend a few seconds collecting the fragments
of information into a coherent thought. Even now, writing this, it's written as
it is thought.</p>
<p>At least the train of thought is allowed to follow the rails to the end, and now
being forced to slow down and nearly stop, for a bit, everytime the context
changes. Friends talking about games, acquaintances talking about a link, posted
minutes ago, until the next link comes along, what I am trying to do, the music
changed track, wait, let me just add this next song to the playlist, oh, James
wants to say &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, why in the Hell did this alarm go off; was I supposed to do
something when it did, probably not important-&ldquo;What? the coffee is done?&ldquo;-Right,
right.</p>
<p>Information overload claims another victim.</p>
