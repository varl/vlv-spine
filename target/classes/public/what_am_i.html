                <p><h1>What/who am I?</h1>
<p>A bipedal sack of skin, covering coffee-fueled meat, traversing the commonality
of every-day. Pragmatically speaking, of course.</p>
<p>I think about this, the same as everyone else I suppose, but rarely come to any
new, fresh realisations. The context of how I think about these two, simple
questions, is most often philosophical in nature; not today however. Today it
is about leverage, or rather, 'to leverage'.</p>
<p>But why am I thinking about leverage in the first place. Perhaps there is
someone that I feel I need leverage on to control, but alas. No, that's not
what today's meager portion of mental energy is spent on. No, no. What makes my
gears grind this particularily dark and dank morning in Oslo is how in the nine
Hells can I leverage my life's feats and create value for others, who in turn
create value for me. It is supposed to be an exchange; I don't merely want
money for the sake of money, I want to <em>entrepreneur</em>.</p>
<p>So, leveraging who and what you are in order to create value. Sounds New Age-y.
Or maybe not. Frank, I don't care! Simmer down. Allow your blood vessels to
carry oxygen unhindered; surely your vascular pressure is not making it any
easier.</p>
<p>My origin I suppose is born into this world from the combined efforts of a
third generation clothes store entrepreneur and a second generation extremely
hard-working jack-of-all-trades. I grew up in clothes stores, every family
dinner revolved mostly around the family business since the very food on the
table was it's product, it seems correct for it to be the center piece of
attention. In short, I grew up. As with everyone, a unique setting leaves marks
and I have spent a few years of adulthood trying to break the chains. I had
greater visions than staying in my small hometown and carrying the family
business torch, not that it was my place to do so from the beginning. I think
that's reserved for my diligent and loyal sister. She carries a Fire, which
might rekindle a waning torch. Who knows. That's not the point.</p>
<p>My 'breaking' the chains has consisted of working as an information technology
consultant (fancy words for a lowly software engineer) for 4+ years now at two
different international &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; firms. One big and one bigger. Meanwhile,
I've also been neglecting my own company, vardevs. The internal strife about
that neglect has been subsided, but I still don't feel good about it and a good
deal of my existential anxiety pours from that fact. I have been making
websites since 1996; at the age of 12 my cousin taught me something that
neither of us probably thought would change the course of my life. HTML and
Photoshop. From there everything has just &hellip; escalated.</p>
<p>The point is, my life has been forged by the fashion retail industry and while
I have lived in Korea and Singapore as a child, visited countless islands
around Indonesia and East-Asia by the age of 10, everything always comes back
to that small shop in the dark forests of Sm√•land, in the belly of Sweden.
Seoul's population is the same as the entirety of Sweden's; how can such a tiny
place with 10'000 people (many hiding in the forest) be of such importance &hellip;
And who am I to try to ditch the baggage?</p>
<p>I suppose that less baggage should mean an easier walkabout, but without
experience, without the origin, how would I ever survive? Is not collecting
baggage, sifting through it, caring for it, sorting it and reflecting upon it
the mark of Man? Not just bearing the burden, but leveraging it into something
more. Something special. Maybe, one day, even something fantastic.</p>
<p>So given my baggage, my experience, my visions and goals; what would you do?</p>
<p>/v.</p>
