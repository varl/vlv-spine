EuroTour

August 2012

The EuroTour 2012 consisted of two machines, two people and some basic gear packed for the trip. 

Me and Molly left our safehouse in Oslo a rainy morning in July -- luckily during a period of 
relief from said rain -- for our vacation on two wheels, blazing a trail through central Europe and what-not.
