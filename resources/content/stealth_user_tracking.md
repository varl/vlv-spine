Stealth positioning devices, as done by professionals
=====================================================
October 2013

If you are carrying a device with that connects to a cellular network then you
are being tracked. Your device can constantly be triangulated to a position with
suprising accuracy, depending on the distance between the masts you are between.

Common knowledge sure, but having worked with service providerss as a
consultant, it is *amazing* how many don't realise, or just do not think about,
the fact that they are being tracked 24/7 by that convenient device they carry
in their pocket.

They don't even have to use webservices to check-in, it is all logged anyway on
a provider level. I wonder how long it will take before a large cellular service
provider starts their own social network, that can auto-publish transcripts you
have with people on your phone, publish text messages between contacts as chats, 
and check you in at locations automatically, without having to so much as reach 
into your pocket.

The biggest ploy against privacy in this century is not PRISM, it's just an
extension of what cellular service providers have been doing for years, honing 
their skills at tracking their users and violating their privacy.

I have acquiantances that think that text messages between two phone numbers are 
somehow private, only seen by two instances; the sender and recipient, but this
is not the case. I have seen gateway operators pick up the contents of text 
messages and even pictures sent over MMS, and much like the TSA operators, they 
have saved the interesting pictures for later use in blatant violation of their 
users' privacy.

If you value privacy, leave your mobile device at home when you want to truly be
private, otherwise, act as if someone is watching.

Someone is always watching.
