ACEM Meditation
===============
May 2014

This weekend (24/25th May) Molly and I took an introductory course in ACEM
style meditation, which in contrary to other forms of meditation root their
practice in the results of scientific research, doing away with the spiritual,
religious and the holistic aspects, instead producing a form of meditation fit
for pragmatics.

Though I am interested in the spirtual aspects as well, and I have been on the
other side of the fence, practiced Buddha's smiling meditation under guidance
of a Qigong instructor during Shaolin retreats.
