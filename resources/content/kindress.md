Kindress
--------

Around a year ago, I started a project I call [Kindress](https://github.com/varl/kindress)
which is a RSS-to-Kindle formatter and converter. I didn't really have a use for 
it, except for the novelty and having my daily feed of toilet literature 
delivered automatically to my Kindle. Don't get me wrong, it was nice, but Google
Reader was my go-to RSS reading service and my read items weren't synced and so
I go a lot of duplicates, stuff I didn't want to read, etcetera, and there was no
real incentive for me to actually work on it.

But now Google Reader is dead, and while I used [Newsbeuter](http://www.newsbeuter.org/)
many of my feeds rely on images and not just text, and since I use it in over SSH
there was a lot of work trying to see related images.

It has its own uses, but if my Kindle does a better job with images maybe I should
resurrect this project and build an RSS service that can generate and send me my
unread items as a pocket book. So far I don't know of a reader service that does 
syncing to Kindle, and it's on that device that I do my prefered reading anyway,
so why not?

Time to re-roll.
