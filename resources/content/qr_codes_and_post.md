Why does the post still use stamps?
-----------------------------------

1. Order "stamps" with a QR code on them containing your mobile phonenumber
2. Put the QR-stamp on a letter 
3. The postal service scans the QR code and sends the amount that will be charged to your number 
4. Confirm the charge over SMS (indicating that you do own the device)

For the life of me I cannot figure out why this is not a viable, already
implemented solution. I'm confident I'm not the only one that hates dealing
with the bullshit at the postal service.
