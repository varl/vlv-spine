Using GitHub as a blogging tool
===============================

For a long time I use my little static site generator [Spine](https://github.com/varl/spine) as a tool to generate 
[vlv.io](http://vlv.io) and a couple of other sites like [v-eng.se](http://v-eng.se) that seldom change.

Now as I settle into vacation-mode a question nags me.

Wouldn't it be nice if Spine was not a library, but rather an application that you just gave a GitHub repo which
has a certain structure and "Bam!", it automatically pulls down the repo and compiles the content + template + static 
files into a site and host it at a specified port?

It would be nice, indeed. So I spent a couple of hours in front of the source code and that is exactly what it does now.

## The writing experience?

I enjoy Vim as a text editor, so almost any writing I do is done using Vim. I create a branch for my unpublished piece
and when I am happy with it I merge it back into master branch and restart the Spine-service and it when starts the
new piece is published.

## No web interface?

Primarily I write locally, but occasionally it would be nice to have a web interface I could just punch markdown into, hit
save and publish, and be done with it.

... GitHub's web markdown editor is pretty much perfect for my needs, and it even lets me commit directly to master or create
a new branch right there in the interface. :D

/v.
