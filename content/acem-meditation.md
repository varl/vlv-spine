ACEM Meditation
===============
May 2014

One weekend at the end of May (24-25th) my partner and I took an introductory course in ACEM
style meditation, which in contrary to other forms of meditation root their
practice in the results of scientific research, doing away with the spiritual,
religious and the holistic aspects, instead producing a form of meditation fit
for pragmatics.

Being a undirected meditation style, the other being directed, you have one
non-spontaneous activity: repeating a 'sound' over and over. Eventually your mind
wanders to other thoughts without you realising it. This can last for seconds or
minutes, and when you realise that your mind has wandered you take the active
decision to start repeating the sound again.

That's it, really. 

Even meditation styles that have you focusing on "nothing" are directed, since 
you direct your thoughts at that nothingness.
  
Repeated 2x30 min per day or 1x45 min per day it is indeed time-consuming, but
the total relaxation is undeniable.
