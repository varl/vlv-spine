Typisht
=======

I used to be fast.

Now, not so much. Maybe it's this keyboard. Maybe it's that I no longer touch-
type. Which is kind of weird, I think I used to do it; At least at work I don't
feel impeded by my typing speed, but at home I do. Why is this?

Am I really a faster typist at work than at home? Is it the constant clicking
and clacking of my mechanical keyboard that does it or am I simply overthinking
it? Is it perhaps that I don't get in the flow as fast; that I don't type as
much nor in as long stretches of time as I do at work?

Am I expelled into a land where all I do is quickly answer IM's over e-mail,

on Facebook,

on Hangouts,

on IRC,

on Text,

...

My mind scattered and divided between dozens of tiny shards of data, never
allowed to simply relax, focus and spend a few seconds collecting the fragments
of information into a coherent thought. Even now, writing this, it's written as
it is thought.

At least the train of thought is allowed to follow the rails to the end, and now
being forced to slow down and nearly stop, for a bit, every time the context 
changes. Friends talking about games, acquaintances talking about a link, posted
minutes ago, until the next link comes along, what I am trying to do, the music
changed track, wait, let me just add this next song to the playlist, oh, James
wants to say "Hi", why in the Hell did this alarm go off; was I supposed to do
something when it did, probably not important-"What? the coffee is done?"-Right,
right.

Information overload claims another victim.
